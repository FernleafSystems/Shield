	<h3>Multi-Factor Authentication Wizard</h3>
	<p>What is Multi-Factor / Two-Factor Authentication?</p>
	<p>Simply put, it is the addition of an extra "factor" during your login process.</p>
	<p>This could various forms, and you've probably seen it elsewhere. Examples include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A memorable question, e.g. What is your favourite color</li>
		<li>Google Authenticator - you supply a random 6-digit code</li>
		<li>Email - you get an email with a link or a code to verify</li>
		<li>SMS - you get text message with a code to verify</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Hopefully you see the pattern - there's a extra piece of information that you must supply. This is your extra "factor".</p>
	<p>If you have a password + 1 other factor, this is called Two-Factor Authentication</p>
	<p>If you have a password + 2 or more other factors, this is called Multi-Factor Authentication</p>
	<p>Shield security lets you setup multiple login factors, and the simplest of which is email. This wizard will walk you
	through setup of these factors.</p>
