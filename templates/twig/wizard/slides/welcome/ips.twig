<h5>Quick Summary:</h5>
<p>Turn on the IP Manager below so Shield can automatically limit login attempts and block automated attacks.</p>
<h4>The Details:</h4>
<p>Many security plugins offer the option of blacklisting IP addresses. But the big secret they're not telling you is
   that this is complete waste of your time.</p>
<p>Can you think of anything you'd rather be doing, than getting 100s of email notifications and then
   having to add IP addresses to some blacklist?</p>
<p>The automatic IP Manager will track bad behaviour, and automatically block repeat offenders.
   But not permanently, because that would make your IP list explode, slowing down your site for normal visitors.</p>
<p>And nobody wants that.</p>

<p>By default, bad visitors are blocked for 1 minute after 10 bad requests.</p>
