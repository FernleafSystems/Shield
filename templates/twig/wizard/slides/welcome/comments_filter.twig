			<p class="description">Shield Security provides highly effective techniques to block bot spam.
			   Also, and unlike Akismet, we never send your private comment data to 3rd parties for
			   processing. You keep it all on your site.

			<p class="description">We also offer Google reCAPTCHA for comments, but you'll need to setup some Google API keys
			   for this first, so we'll leave you to do that later.</p>
			<p class="description">There's also an option to protect against Human SPAMmers. But again, to get
