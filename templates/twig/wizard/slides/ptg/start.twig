	<h3>Start: Plugin & Theme Guard</h3>
	<p>What is the Plugin & Theme Guard?</p>
	<p>The purpose of this scanner is to detect potentially malicious or
	   unintended changes to any plugin or theme files.</p>
	<p>Why is this important?</p>
	<p>It is common for hacks to involve modifications to existing plugin and theme files.</p>
	<p>This scanner will detect any changes, any files that are missing, and any new files that have been added.</p>
	<p>If you're in doubt about the results, please discuss the findings with your hosting provider.</p>
